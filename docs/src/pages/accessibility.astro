  <p>
    These components aim to be accessible to all users, whether they are using
    touch screens, keyboards, screen readers, or other assistive technology.
    ARIA is used when necessary to enhance the underlying HTML. Focus is managed
    where appropriate. The components have been tested with a variety of
    browsers and screen readers.
  </p>

  <Heading level={2} id="guarantee">Guaranteeâ€¦?</Heading>

  <p>
    In some regards the components offered here are akin to design system
    components. They are low-level pieces to a larger puzzle. The components
    themselves strive to offer the best possible accessible <em>baseline</em>.
    But beyond that, any guarantees that can be made regarding accessibility are
    limited. The way the components get used and combined can still lead to
    inaccessible outcomes.
  </p>

  <p>
    If you are composing these components into more complex interfaces, you will
    need to test and evaluate accessibility yourself.
  </p>

  <Heading level={2}>Approach</Heading>

  <p>
    The <code>{`<calendar-month>`}</code> component uses a standard
    <code>{`<table>`}</code> to display a grid of dates. Notably, the
    <code>grid</code> role is not used. Therefore, to navigate the columns, rows,
    and cells, users can use standard table navigation commands.
  </p>

  <p>
    Each <code>{`<table>`}</code> is labelled with the month name. Each column is
    labelled with the day name. Each cell contains a button, which displays the date
    as a number, but is labelled non-visually with the full date e.g.
    <em>"19 April"</em>. The format of the date label depends on the given
    locale.
  </p>

  <p>
    <code>aria-pressed</code> is used on buttons to mark selected dates. For single
    date selection, only one day will ever be marked as pressed. For date ranges,
    a contiguous set of days will be marked as pressed.
  </p>

  <p>
    The <code>{`<calendar-date>`}</code> and <code>{`<calendar-range>`}</code> components
    use a <code>group</code> role, which is labelled with the month and year(s) currently
    displayed e.g. <em>"April &ndash; June 2024"</em>. This is marked as a live
    region, so changes are communicated to users as they navigate through dates.
    How this is formatted depends on the given locale.
  </p>

  <p>
    The "Previous" and "Next" buttons are marked as disabled via
    <code>aria-disabled</code>, so that focus does not get lost when users reach
    the <code>min</code> or <code>max</code> date.
  </p>

  <Heading level={2}>Testing</Heading>

  <p>
    At a minimum testing will be done with the following browser and screen
    reader combinations:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Chrome + NVDA</li>
    <li>Chrome + JAWS</li>
    <li>Firefox + NVDA</li>
    <li>Safari + VoiceOver</li>
  </ul>

  <p>These combinations were last tested April 2024.</p>

  <Heading level={2}>Known issues</Heading>

  <p>
    There are some minor issues in how date ranges formatted via
    <code>Intl.DateTimeFormat</code> (e.g.
    <em>"April &ndash; June 2024"</em>) get announced. JAWS announces
    <em>"April en dash June 2024"</em>. This may be confusing to users if they
    do not understand what an "en dash" is. In contrast, VoiceOver and NVDA do
    not announce the dash at all, announcing <em>"April June 2024"</em>. This
    may obscure the fact that a date range is being announced. There is no
    viable mitigation for this right now. Locale-aware date formatting is
    complex, and so we must rely on the native <code>Intl.DateTimeFormat</code> API.
